# oxen.js

##Preface
This is my first public javascript library EVAR. I know, I'm nervous too. Hold my hand and we'll get through it together.

##What's the point?
A simple script to create a comma separated list, with the last item being separated by an ampersand (&). So it turns this:
`["Red", "Green", "Blue"]`
Into this:
`Red, Green, & Blue`
It subscribes to the Oxford Comma, of course. I didn't know of one, so I made it.

##What else?
No, nothing else. That's it. Use it if you like.
